        The Coversation between HARPAGON, LA FLÈCHE.
    </h4>

   <h6 class="HARPAGON"> HARPAGON</h6>  
    <p class="speech"> Get out of here, this moment; and let me have no more of your
        prating. Now then, be gone out of my house, you sworn pickpocket, you
        veritable gallows' bird..</p>
        


   <h6 class=" LA FLÈCHE">  LA FLÈCHE </h6> 
   <p class="speech">I never saw anything more wicked than this
    cursed old man; and I truly believe, if I may be allowed to say so,
    that he is possessed with a devil. </p> 
        


   <h6 class="HARPAGON"> </h6>
   <p class="speech">  What are you muttering there between your teeth?
   </p>
        


    <h6 class=" LA FLÈCHE">  LA FLÈCHE</h6>
    <p class="stagedirection"> [Whoa now!]</p>
    <p class="speech">Why do you send me away?.</p>

   <h6 class="HARPAGON"> HARPAGON</h6>  
   <p class="speech">
    You dare to ask me my reasons, you scoundrel? Out with you, this
    moment, before I give you a good thrashing.
    .</p>
         


   <h6 class="LA FLÈCHE"> LA FLÈCHE</h6> 
   <p class="speech">  What have I done to you?.</p>
        

   <h6 class="HARPAGON"> HARPAGON</h6> 
   <p class="speech"> Done this, that I wish you to be off...</p>
         
   <h6 class="LA FLÈCHE"> LA FLÈCHE</h6> 
   <p class="stagedirection">You're kidding yourself</p>
   <p class="speech">My master, your son, gave me orders to wait for him.</p>
        

   <h6 class="HARPAGON"> HARPAGON</h6>
   <p class="speech"> Go and wait for him in the street, then; out with you; don't stay
    in my house, straight and stiff as a sentry, to observe what is going
    on, and to make your profit of everything. I won't always have before
    me a spy on all my affairs; a treacherous scamp, whose cursed eyes
    watch all my actions, covet all I possess, and ferret about in every
    corner to see if there is anything to steal..</p>
        
   <h6 class="LA FLÈCHE">LA FLÈCHE</h6> 
   <p class="stagedirection">How tiresome you are! </p>
   <p class="speech">How the deuce could one steal anything from you? Are you a man
    likely to be robbed when you put every possible thing under lock and
    key, and mount guard day and night?
    </p>
