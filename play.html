        SCENE 4 --VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES.</h4><br>

        <p>VAL. (_laughing_). Well, Master Jacques, your frankness is badly
rewarded, I fear.<br></p>
<br>

<p>JAC. S'death! Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man of consequence, it
is no business of yours as far as I can see. Laugh at your own
cudgelling when you get it, and don't come here and laugh at mine.<br></p>

<br>

<p>VAL. Ah! Master Jacques, don't get into a passion, I beg of you.<br>
<br></p>

<p>JAC. (_aside_). He is drawing in his horns. I will put on a bold face,
and if he is fool enough to be afraid of me, I will pay him back
somewhat. (_To_ VALÈRE) Do you know, Mr. Grinner, that I am not
exactly in a laughing humour, and that if you provoke me too much, I
shall make you laugh after another fashion. (JACQUES _pushes_ VALÈRE
_to the farther end of the stage, threatening him_.)</p><br>
<br>

<p><VAL.  Gently, gently.</p> <br>
<br>
<p><JAC. How gently? And if it does not please me to go gently? </p> <br>
<br>

<br>

<h6><h6 class="VAL">JAC</h6>
<p class="stagedirection"></p>JAC.

<p class="speech"> <p> You are an impudent rascal.<br></p>p>
<br>

<h6><h6 class="JAC"></h6>
    <p class="stagedirection"></p></h6>
    <p class="speech"> <p> Master Jacques....<br></p>
<br>

<h6>JAC.</h6><h6 class="VAL"></h6>
<p class="stagedirection"></p></h6>
<p class="speech"<p> None of your Master Jacques here! If I take up a stick, I shall
soon make you feel it.<br></p>
<br>

<h6>VAL.</h6><h6 class="JAC"></h6>
<p class="stagedirection"></p></h6>
<p class="speech"<p> What do you mean by a stick? (_Drives back_ JACQUES _in his
turn_.)<br></p>
<br>

<h6>JAC.<h6 class=""></h6>
<p class="stagedirection"></p></h6>
<p class="speech"</h6>
<h6 class=""></h6>
    <p class="stagedirection"></p></h6>
    p class="speech" <p>No; I don't say anything about that.<br></p>
<br>

<h6>VAL.</h6><p> Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man to give you a drubbing
in good earnest? <br></p>
<br>

<h6>JAC.</h6><p> I have no doubt of it.<br></p>
<br>

<h6>VAL.</h6> <p></p>That, after all, you are nothing but a scrub of a cook?<br></p>
<br>

<h6>JAC.</h6><p> I know it very well.<br></p>
<br>

<h6>VAL.</h6><p> And that you don't know me yet?<br></p>
<br>

<h6>JAC.</h6><p> I beg your pardon.<br></p>
<br>

<h6>VAL.</h6> <p>You will beat me, you say?<br></p>
<br>

<h6>JAC.</h6><p> I only spoke in jest.<br></p>
<br>

<h6 class="VAL"></h6>
    <p class="stagedirection"></p></h6>
    <p class="speech"VAL. <p> I don't like your jesting, and (_beating_ JACQUES) remember that
you are but a sorry hand at it.<br></p>
<br>

<h6 class="JAC"></h6>
    <p class="stagedirection"></p></h6>
    <p class="speech"<p>JAC. (_alone_). Plague take all sincerity; it is a bad trade. I give
it up for the future, and will cease to tell the truth. It is all very
well for my master to beat me; but as for that Mr. Steward, what right
has he to do it? I will be revenged on him if I can.<br></p>
