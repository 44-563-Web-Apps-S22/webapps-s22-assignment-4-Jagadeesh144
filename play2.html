    <p class="speech"> He whom the cap fits, let him wear it.
        lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,
        And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.
        If anyone comes calling, say I have gone
        To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.</p>

    <h6 class="HARPAGON"> HARPAGON </h6>   
     <p class="speech">Such affectation and boastful behavior!
        The Miser.  What do you wish?</p>
       
     <h6 class="The Miser" > The Miser</h6> 
     <p class="speech"> (_showing_ HARPAGON _one of his doublet pockets_). Just look,
        here is one more pocket. Are you satisfied?
        
        HAR. Come, give it up to me without all that fuss.</p>
